Take a look at how the following three events are celebrated in different countries.\n\n• New Year\nChildren in Taiwan love the Chinese New Year because they get hong bao (red envelopes with money inside) from their relatives. On the other hand, in Ecuador, people say good-bye to the old year by burning life-size dummies dressed in old clothes on big bonfires. These dummies represent something that had a negative impact on the community or someone's well-being.\n\n• Birthdays\nIn Korea, on a baby's first birthday, parents put money, thread, and pencils in front of their baby. If the baby picks up the money, it means he or she is going to be rich. Choosing the thread means a long life for the baby, and choosing a pencil means he or she is going to be a good student. Meanwhile, in India, kids wear brand new clothes on their birthdays and show their parents signs of respect by touching their parents' feet.\n\n• Weddings\nIn Colombia, the bride and groom each light a candle. Then they light a third candle together and blow out the first two. The third candle means that they are now one and are going to share their lives together. Whereas, in the United Kingdom, Australia, and North America, brides wear \"something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue\" for good luck. Simultaneously, in Turkey, the female friends of the bride write their names inside her shoes. After the wedding ceremony, the bride looks inside her shoes. If she can no longer read one of her friends' names, it means that friend is going to get married next.\n\nAdapted from McCarthy, M. & McCarten J. & Sandiford, H. (2014).
